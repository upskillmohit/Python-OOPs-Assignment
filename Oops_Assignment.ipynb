        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        " - A programming moded that emphasizes on data and objects. It helps to design software using concepts like data encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - A class is a blue print or template that has some properties and methods.For example: Class Customer has properties like Name, CustomerId, Email etc. and has methods like getOrders(), getKeys() etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class. It is used to access member data and methods of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Abstraction is hiding of complex details from the user and showing only relevant information to a user. For example: While purchasing a new refrigerator a salespesron highlight features which can be used by customer but do not explain about internal functioning or details of the refrigerator.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is wrapping of data and functions and defining the scope to access them. It ensures safety of data so object data cannot be modified accidentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "   - Dunder/Magical methods are defined by pre-built classes. They are surrounded by double underscore(__) and commonly used for operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The ability to inherit the properties and methods of a class is known as inheritance.It helps to implement code reusablility. For example:\n",
        "  \n",
        "   class A:\n",
        "  \n",
        "    def fuctionaA():\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(\"Function of Base Class\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    class B(A):\n",
        "\n",
        "    def functionB():\n",
        "  \n",
        "    print(\"Function of Derived Class\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    obj = B\n",
        "  \n",
        "    obj.fuctionaA()\n",
        "  \n",
        "    obj.functionB()\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - The ability of an object to behave differently when calling a method with same name is known as Polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation can be achieved by specifying private and protected members in a class. Declaring private variables in the class, ensure it can only be accessed from within the class. And protected members of a class can only be accessed by the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " - It is a dunder method used to initialize the members of a class while creating it's object\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " - A class method is bound to a class rather than object of a class. It is created using @classmethod decorator and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Static methods are bound to a class but do not require self parameter. It is created using @staticmethod decorator but cannot modify class state\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " - It allows a class to define multiple methods with same name but different parameters. It is implemented within the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        " - It allows a child class to define method with the same name and same parameters as in the parent class. It is implemented in the derived class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " - A property decorator is used to define a method as property. It is used to get, set and delete private member of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It increases code readability and maintainability by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.\n",
        "   - It increases code reusablility by allowing objects of different classes to be trated as object of common classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An abstract class has one ore more abstract methods without any implementation. It will throw an error when instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Helps to organize the software design.\n",
        "  - It increases code readability and maintainability by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.\n",
        "  - It increases code reusablility by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as object of common classes.\n",
        "  - It helps to maintain the code.\n",
        "  - It ensures safety of data so object data cannot be modified accidentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - A class variable is bound to a class rather than object of a class.\n",
        "    - An instance variable is bound to an object of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A child class inherited from two or more classes implement multiple inheritance in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Class A:\n",

        "        body C\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\" methods in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - __str__  - It is used to return a readable and user friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "   - __repr__ - It is used to return a detailed and unambiguous string reprsentation of an object\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Super() function is used to invoke the methods of parent or base class. It increases code readability and maintainability by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "   \n",
        "    - __del__ is dunder method that is used for cleanup operations before an object is destroyed. It is also know as destructor method.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class method is bound to a class rather than object of a class. It is created using @classmethod decorator and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Static methods are bound to a class but do not require self parameter. It is created using @staticmethod decorator but cannot modify class state\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Create a base class with a method that can be overridden in the child class\n",
        "  - Add new implmentation to the method in a derived class\n",
        "  - Create object of derived class and invoke the overriden method\n",
        "  - Method will return results as per new implementation in the derived class\n",
        "  \n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It is a programming technique used to invoke multiple methods on an object in a single statement with each method returning the object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It is a dunder method that allows instance of a class to be called like a function. It is useful for creating callable objects."
